# Implication of Time Varying Stock-Bond Correlation for Portfolio Diversification

### Abstract
There are divided views on existence and extent of time variation within stock-
bond correlation. Diversification benefit of the portfolio depends on the stock-
bond correlation. Numerous studies have been conducted to examine the factors
responsible for movement in stock-bond correlation. Surprisingly, the implications
of time varying stock bond correlation on portfolio diversification and risk are not
well developed. Through our empirical findings we demonstrate that the stock-bond
correlation vary with time. The correlations are estimated using rolling window and
DCC GARCH(1,1) model. Our findings indicate that portfolio diversification and
portfolio performance show a linear as well as quadratic relationship. We further
analyse the relationship with a vector autoregressive (VAR) model and report the
impulse response of diversification benefit to shocks in correlation.

### Data
We have used S&P 500 index and US Government 10 year treasury bond as proxies for
stock and bond asset class respectively. S&P 500 is a cap-weighted index comprising of
500 large companies listed on New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) and NASDAQ. S&P 500
is a major stock index in the United States and closely resemble the US economy making
it a good choice to be considered as a proxy for asset class of stock.

Previous studies have used US Government 10 year treasury as they represent a long term view
on economy and are liquid. 30 day US treasury bills have been used as a representative
of risk free rate for calculation of Sharpe ratio.
Monthly data ranging from December 1974 to December 2016 derived from the CRSP
database has been used in the study, however the data from Decemeber 1974 to Decemeber
1979 has been used only for the purpose of calculation of parameters fo rolling window as
described in next section. The actual study of stock-bond correlation and its implications
ranges from January 1980 to December 2016.
